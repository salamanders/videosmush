Timelapse of mp4 using adaptive frame blending

Given an input.mp4 source video which is more than 60 seconds taken from a fixed camera on a tripod, smush down the
video to a 60-second timelapse by merging the frames that have very little difference.  
Keep at least 30 output frames with a single source frame.
